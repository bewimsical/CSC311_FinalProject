## Overview
Gamenight is a SAAS (software as a service) application that allows people to log what board games they own, add friends to their account, and then link board game libraries with said users friends in order to plan a game night.  
The planning phase involves everyone seeing each other's libraries and voting on what games should be played. There are also fields to name the group, set a time for the meeting, and pick where the meeting is taking place.
